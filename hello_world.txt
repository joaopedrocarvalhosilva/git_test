"Hi, I am learning Git. Up to now I have learned that you can create a directory
 in the command line using mkdir, them you create a repository in GitHub and clone
  the SSH adress in your command line, using git clone, then you can modify files,
   send them to the staged area, using git add, them you can commit it using git
    commit -m "Add (name of the file staged)""
